\section{Section}\label{introduction}

The network synthesis process implemented in this work aims to develop a one port passive electrical circuit which reproduces a specified frequency dependent impedance function. The impedance function may be represented in a rational function form or in a pole-residue form and the resulting network is developed as a Spice sub-circuit model. 

The software is written in Fortran and includes a Makefile to allow the software to be compiled under unix. Windows users may install Cygwin (which is effectively a unix type environment) and then compile the software under cygwin. 

This document describes the theory which underlies the modelling of frequency dependent transfer functions as passive circuits in Spice before describing the software which implements the process and presenting some examples of the process in action.
